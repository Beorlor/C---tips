# C-tips Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the C-tips repository! This is a personal collection of C programming tips and tricks I've gathered during my apprenticeship. It's designed as a quick reference guide for myself, but I hope it can be useful to others learning C.

## Contents Overview
- [**General Tips**](#current-tips): Various tips and tricks in C programming, each within its own folder.
- **Code Comments**: For folders without a README, explanations are provided as comments within the code.
- [**Hashtable**](#hashtable): A comprehensive, ready-to-use library for C projects. [Documentation here](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Hashtable).

## Hashtable
The [Hashtable](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Hashtable) section of this repository features a fully-functional library designed for use in C projects. This library provides an efficient way to store and retrieve data using hash tables, a data structure that offers fast data access through unique keys. The implementation focuses on performance and ease of use, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Detailed documentation is available to help users integrate this library into their projects, covering aspects such as setup, usage examples, and customization options. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application, this Hashtable library is a robust and reliable solution for managing data efficiently.

## Current Tips

- [**Dynamic Programming**](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Dynamic_Programming): Strategies for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- [**Inline Keyword**](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Inline_Keyword): Usage of `inline` for optimizing function calls.
- [**Process Control Examples**](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Process_Control): Demonstrations of process creation and management.
- [**Static Variable**](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Static_Variable): Understanding and using static variables in C.
- [**Union Usage**](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Union_Usage): Utilizing unions for hardware register representation or simulating polymorphism.
- [**Variadic Functions**](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Variadic_Functions): Examples of functions handling variable number of arguments, similar to `printf`.
- [**Volatile Keyword**](https://github.com/Beorlor/C-tips/tree/main/Volatile_Keyword): Explaining the use of `volatile` for special variable conditions.
