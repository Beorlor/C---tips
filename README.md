# C-tips Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the C-tips repository! This is a personal collection of C programming tips and tricks I've gathered during my apprenticeship. It's designed as a quick reference guide for myself, but I hope it can be useful to others learning C.

## Contents Overview
- **General Tips**: Various tips and tricks in C programming, each within its own folder.
- **Code Comments**: For folders without a README, explanations are provided as comments within the code.
- **Hashtable**: A ready-to-use library for C projects. [Documentation here](#).

## Current Tips
- **Single Bit Manipulation and Bitmaps**: Techniques for efficient bit-level operations.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Strategies for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Inline Keyword**: Usage of `inline` for optimizing function calls.
- **Process Control Examples**: Demonstrations of process creation and management.
- **Static Variable**: Understanding and using static variables in C.
- **Union Usage**: Utilizing unions for hardware register representation or simulating polymorphism.
- **Variadic Functions**: Examples of functions handling variable number of arguments, similar to `printf`.
- **Volatile Keyword**: Explaining the use of `volatile` for special variable conditions.

## Future Topics (To-Do)
- **Malloc**: Recreating the Malloc and Free functions for custom memory management.
- **Threads**: Basic concepts and examples of multithreading in C.
- **Makefile**: Comprehensive guide for creating and managing makefiles.
- **Library Static and Dynamic**: Detailed instructions on creating and using both static and dynamic libraries.
- **Networking**: Practical tips for network programming in C.
- **Enum**: Best practices for using enums effectively.
- **Sort Algorithms**: Detailed implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms.
- **Daemon**: Techniques for creating and managing daemon processes.
- **Telnet**: Deep dive into the Telnet protocol and its practical applications.
- **SSH**: Exploring Secure Shell (SSH) for secure communications and programming tips.
