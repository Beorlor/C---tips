# C---tips
This repository is a storage of some C tips and tricks,
I've found during my apprenticeship.

The list is not exaushtiv cause its for me to remenber certain thing.

For exemple there is no Fork folder cause ive worked enough on this
in other project, like Pipex, Minishell or Philosopher.
Same for graph, ect...

To Do :
-Fork_Pipe
-HashMap
-Threads

-Malloc
-Daemon
-Telnet
-SSH
-Binary tree
