# C---tips
This repository is a storage of some C tips and tricks,
I've found during my apprenticeship.

The list is not exaushtiv cause its for me to remenber certain thing.

For exemple there is no Fork folder cause ive worked enough on this
in other project, like Pipex, Minishell or Philosopher.
Same for graph, ect...

If a folder doesnt have a README, all the info are in commentary in the code itself

The code is not made to be reuse like it is, but act more as a reminder.
Except Hashtable which is a library ready to use

Hashtable is readdy to use for your c project
with documentation
