Reproduction of a Hashtable in C

Basic Hashtable that deal with collision with separate chaining
but doesnt have load factor and rehashing

"make' create a static library, a dynamic one, and a program to test the library

test : initialize the hash table with the content of a text file (first argument) then display it.
To end it generate n random words (second argument) and look if they are in the hashtable, then say how many of n words where in hashtable.

-------------------------------------------------

General info about Hashtable

We can deal with collision with chain Hashing or linear probing or quadratic probing or double hashing

In C++ std::unordered_map (pair key value) and std::unordered_set (presence of individual element) use separate chaining, load factor, rehashing
